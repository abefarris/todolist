Play Framework JavaTodoList taken from this tutorial:

I will continue to modify it as a learning exercise.  The end goal will be a production ready web application.

To run with in-memory database use play -Dconfig.resource=test.conf.  The default configuration uses postgreSql.

Tasks to complete:

1.  Prettify html with bootstrap
2.  Add paging for task list view
3.  Add secure social plugin for user enabled task lists
4.  Add social linking similar to GitHub star for activity stream view
5.  Add commenting system
